Coca-Cola Corporate Retailers Dashboard

I have created an interactive Power BI dashboard built from scratch representing a fictional data of the Coca-Cola Corporate Retailers. This project demonstrates how to:

- Define and visualise key performance indicators (KPIs), bring critical metrics to life with scorecards and trend visuals.

- Use slicers for dynamic filtering, allowing users to explore data by categories such as date ranges, regions, or product segments.

- Incorporate data visuals, including line charts, bar charts, and geographic maps, for powerful data storytelling.

- Design effective, story-driven layouts, combining visuals and interactivity to support actionable business insights.
